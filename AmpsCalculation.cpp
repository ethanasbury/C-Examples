//Brief Description:
//		A program that will calculate the Amps and Watts of certain Voltage and Resistance.

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	double volts, resistance, amps, watts;
	
	cout << "Enter the Voltage: ";
	cin >> volts;
	cout << "Enter the Resistance: ";
	cin >> resistance;

	amps = volts / resistance;
	watts = pow(amps,2) * resistance;


	cout << "Amps are: " << amps << endl;
	cout << "Watts are: " << watts << endl;

	return 0;









}

/* Program Output:

Enter the Voltage: 120
Enter the Resistance: 9.29
Amps are: 12.9171
Watts are: 1550.05
Press any key to continue . . .
